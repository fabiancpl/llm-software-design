As an expert in requirement analysis for software engineering, define the user stories that fit the next description of the need. For each user story define a short title, a description and the acceptance criteria.

Description:  
Let’s simulate an online store from the command-line interface. A customer is able to see all the available products and purchase one or more units of a product as long as they are available. During the purchase, the customer needs to provide his/her username. All the purchases need to be recorded and affect the product inventory. A manager, logged in through username and password, is able to check and update the available units of a product.

The manager’s credentials, products and inventory need to be previously created on the database. Customers don’t need to be previously created. The database system is based on CSV files.
