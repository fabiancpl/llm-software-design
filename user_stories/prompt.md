As an expert in requirements analysis for software engineering, define the user stories that correspond to the following user need description. For each user story, provide a short title, description, and acceptance criteria.

Description:  
Let's simulate an online store using the command-line interface. Customers can view all available products and purchase one or more units of a product, as long as stock is available. During the purchase, the customer must provide their username. All purchases must be recorded and update the product inventory. A manager, logged in with a username and password, can check and update the available units of a product.

Manager credentials, products and inventory must be preloaded into the database. Customers don't need to be preloaded. The database system is built using CSV files.
